# ShinyApp_Lottery

This project uses the lottery data from Texas Mega Millions and designs a shiny app for users to retrieve past drawings and explores statistics via tables and plots. Based on the statistics, users are also allowed to generate new potential winning numbers. It is created for STA 523 Final project.
